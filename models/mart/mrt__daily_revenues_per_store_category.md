{% docs mrt__daily_revenues_per_store_category %}

This model computes an aggregated view of all historical sales per store X category
including:
- **Total revene in dollars**
- **Total revenue pre-discount in dollars**
- **Count of orders made**

This allows us to identify if some stores specialized in selling certain categories and/or if assortment optimization could help boost sales from low-performing stores
